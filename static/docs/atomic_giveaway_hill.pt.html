<h1 id="atomic-giveaway-hill">Atomic-Giveaway-Hill</h1>
<p>A hybrid of three variants Antichess, Atomic and King of the Hill gives Atomic-Giveaway-Hill. The ultimate goal of the game is to either loose all your pieces like in antichess or get your king to the centre of the board like in King of the Hill, but like in Atomic chess the pieces you capture will get blasted.</p>

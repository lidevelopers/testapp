<p><em>Lose all your pieces (or get stalemated) to win the game.</em></p>
<p>Antichess is an eccentric variant where you lose all your pieces or get stalemated to win.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pieces move the same way they do in standard chess; however, kings lose their royal powers - they cannot castle, and checks are no longer a threat. Since kings have lost their royal powers, pawns may be promoted to kings. </li>
<li>Capturing is forced. If you can take a piece, you must. If multiple pieces can be captured, you may choose which piece you capture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
To compensate for the nature of Antichess, you will always be given a chance to decide for promotions, even if you have enabled the option to always promote to Queens.</p>

<h1 id="antiatomic">Antiatomic</h1>
<p>This is a hybrid variant, which combines the rules of <a href="https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/variants/antichess">Antichess</a> and <a href="https://lichess.org/variant/atomic">Atomic chess</a>. Here, the goal is same as antichess- lose all your pieces or get stalemated to win, but the capture of pieces result in explosions according to atomic rules. </p>
<p>If this variant is played perfectly from both sides, its a forced draw, as whichever piece captures also gets captured while capturing.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with chess, then you probably didn't come here to learn the rules of chess. Please try some variants!</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with chess, then the rules are widely available on the internet, such as on Wikipedia or premier chess sites like <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess.org</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/">chess.com</a>.</p>
<p>As with other variants, you can play chess on Pychess Variants against other people or the AI. You can also set custom positions by adjusting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation">FEN</a> and play games with those using standard chess rules.</p>

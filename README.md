## Supported browsers

Liantichess should support almost all browsers. Though older browsers (including any version of Internet Explorer) will not work. For your own sake, please upgrade. Security and performance, think about it!

Only [Fairy-Stockfish analysis](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/analysis/antichess) might not work on all browsers. The browser support can be found [here](https://github.com/TheYoBots/stockfish.wasm#requirements).
